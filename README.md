# Projects

This is a repository of a collection of my reports/projects/research projects and final materials that I would like to showcase for the public. Basically, it consists of things that I am proud of. I hope you all enjoy!

## Kaczmarz Iteration.pdf

Here I took an an image, blurred it and reconstructed it using a technique known as Kaczmarz Iteration is a method of solving linear systems Ax = b. The idea is to consider the equation row by row, and project the current approximation to the solution (usually start at the origin) to the hyperplane of solutions defined by the equation from the first row of the matrix.

By projecting onto each successive equation of the matrix, we eventually find the solution of the whole equation, which occurs at the intersection of all the planes (defined by each row of the linear system).

This method is desirable because
* Simple implementations
* Rapidly convergent
* Stable with respect to round-off errors
* Method informs us of the quality of approximation at negligible computational cost
* Desirable properties of the system are preserved (e.g. symmetry, sparsity)

## 1708-Devathi-TohokuPoster-Final.pdf

This is a poster I presented at the CWRU-Tohoku Data Science Symposium. My project was to study the degradation mechanisms of Polyurethane under accelerated weather exposure. I primarily focused on color changes of the material. The main skill I gained from this project was the ability to clean data from a sparse tree of folders, and aggregate it all into one tidy dataframe for proper analysis. I would include the data in my repository, but that was requested to be left in the lab's local hard drive.

## 1710-351-451-Proj1-Report-dxd310.pdf

This project was part of my Exploratory Data Science class. The professor is also the Principal Investigator of the Solar Durability and Lifetime Extension (SDLE) Center, where I completed the Degradation study in the aforementioned research project.

Skills I learned primarily include data cleaning using dplyr, and beginning to perform a network model using the <S|M|R> technique, or the Stressor/Mechanism/Response Framework, that is described in the report.

## 1711-04-Resume.pdf

This is my Resume, updated as of November 4th, 2017.
