# Projects

This is a repository of a collection of my reports/projects/research projects and final materials that I would like to showcase for the public. Basically, it consists of things that I am proud of. I hope you all enjoy!

## Kaczmarz Iteration.pdf

School Project using Kaczmarz Iteration to solve an inverse problem that is ill-posed. 

## Image Reconstruction - Tikhonov Regularization.pdf

## 1708-Devathi-TohokuPoster-Final.pdf

This is a poster I presented at the CWRU-Tohoku Data Science Symposium. My project was to study the degradation mechanisms of Polyurethane under accelerated weather exposure. I primarily focused on color changes of the material. The main skill I gained from this project was the ability to clean data from a sparse tree of folders, and aggregate it all into one tidy dataframe for proper analysis. I would include the data in my repository, but that was requested to be left in the lab's local hard drive.

## 1710-351-451-Proj1-Report-dxd310.pdf

This project was part of my Exploratory Data Science class. The professor is also the Principal Investigator of the Solar Durability and Lifetime Extension (SDLE) Center, where I completed the Degradation study in the aforementioned research project.

Skills I learned primarily include data cleaning using dplyr, and beginning to perform a network model using the <S|M|R> technique, or the Stressor/Mechanism/Response Framework, that is described in the report.

## 1711-04-Resume.pdf

This is my Resume, updated as of November 4th, 2017.
